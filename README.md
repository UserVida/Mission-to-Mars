# Overview of Project - Mission to Mars

The purpose of this project was to prepare a web application that would scrape information about the planet Mars from the web and present it on a single page.

Chrome Developter Tools was used to identify the HTML components while BeautifulSoup and Splinter was used to automate the scraping process.
The data was stored using MongoDB. Finally, Flask was used to create a web application to display the data. In addition, Bootstrap was used to add additional polish
to the web application through:

* Modifying the grid of the web app to make it mobile friendly 

* Adding a background image and coloured text to the jumbotron

* Making the hemisphere images circular
